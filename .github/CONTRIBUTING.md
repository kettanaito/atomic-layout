## Development

- [**TypeScript**][typescript] (_JavaScript superset with strong types_)

### Monorepo structure

- [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) (_monorepo manager_)

Atomic Layout is a _mono-repository_. This means that it contains multiple repositories listed in the `packages/` directory. Examples of such repositories are:

- `packages/atomic-layout-core`
- `packages/atomic-layout`

When developing a feature or fixing an issue, navigate to the respective repository in the `packages/` directory. For example, to fix an issue in `atomic-layout` library perform the following commands:

```bash
$ cd packages/atomic-layout
```

Each package has the set of similar commands for development and testing, but always check the list of commands in the respective `package.json` file. Instructions below will explain a general development workflow using `packages/atomic-layout` as an example.

### Running a local build

To build the package in development mode run:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Running Storybook

- [Storybook][storybook] (_UI component explorer_)

Atomic Layout development is done in [Storybook](#). Each story is a usage scenario and _end-to-end test suite_ at the same time. Please check the existing stories before creating a new one, there is a high change such usage scenario already exists.

```bash
$ yarn storybook
```

#### Creating a story

To create a new story choose a proper folder in the `examples/` directory and create a new `MyNewStory.jsx` file. Please refer to the existing stories for reference and inspiration.

Here's an example of how a new story may look like:

```tsx
// examples/components/Composition/NewUseCase.jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Composition } from 'atomic-layout'

const NewUseCase = () => (
  <Composition templateCols="250px 1fr">
    <span id="first">First</span>
    <span id="second">Second</span>
  </Composition>
)

export default NewUseCase
```

> Replace `NewUseCase` with the cammelCase title of the use case you are describing.

After the story is created add it to the list of all stories in `examples/index.js`:

```js
// examples/index.js
const NewUseCase = require('./components/Composition/NewUseCase')

storiesOf('Components|Composition', module).add('New use case', NewUseCase)
```

> If you are adding a new story you must also [add a new E2E test](#writing-e2e-tests) that tests that story. A story without a corresponding E2E test is considered unnecessary.

Verify your story by [Running Storybook](#running-storybook) and finding your new story in the respective section in Storybook.

## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in Atomic Layout: _unit_ and _end-to-end_ (E2E) tests. Depending on the type of your changes you would need to run one or both test types to verify your changes.

### Unit tests

#### Running unit tests

- [Jest][jest] (_JavaScript testing framework_)

To run all unit tests of the library execute the following command:

```bash
$ yarn test:unit
```

#### Writing unit tests

Create a `[filename].spec.ts` file alongside the module you would like to test. Refer to the existing test suites (`*.spec.ts`) for and inspiration.

Here's an example of a small unit test:

```ts
import myNewModule from './my-new-module'

describe('My New Module', () => {
  describe('given a number', () => {
    it('should multiply by 2', () => {
      expect(myNewModule(5)).toEqual(10)
    })
  })
})
```

Verify your newly added unit test by running:

```bash
$ yarn jest path/to/my-new-module.spec.ts
```

<img src="../materials/github/contrib-unit-test.png" alt="Unit test verification" width="500" />

##### Useful unit testing materials:

- [**Jest assertions**][jest-assertions]

### E2E tests

- [Cypress][cypress] (_JavaScript end-to-end testing framework_)

End-to-end tests are being run against a running Storybook instance. **This means you should [run Storybook](#running-storybook) first, before trying to run end-to-end tests**.

#### Running E2E tests

To run E2E tests locally, perform:

```bash
$ yarn cypress
```

> This launches a [Cypress][cypress] app with a list of test suites. Choose a specific test suite to run, or run all tests.

#### Writing E2E tests

E2E tests assert certain usage scenarios. First, add a usage scenario by [Creating a new story](#creating-a-story) in Storybook.

Once you've created the usage scenario, add a new `[scenario].test.js` module next to your newly created scenario. This will be your end-to-end test suite.

Here's an example of what an E2E test suite may look like:

```tsx
describe('New usage scenario', () => {
  before(() => {
    cy.loadStory(['components', 'composition'], ['new-use-case'])
  })

  it('should render two columns', () => {
    cy.get('#first').should('be.visible')
    cy.get('#second').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

Please refer to the existing end-to-end tests for inspiration.

Verify your newly created E2E test by [Running E2E tests](#running-e2e-tests) and choosing your E2E test suite in the list of available tests.

<img src="../materials/github/contrib-e2e-test.png" alt="Unit test verification" width="500" />

##### Useful E2E testing materials:

- [**Cypress assertions**][cypress-assertions]
- [Custom Cypress commands][repo-cy-commands]

### Verifying changes

There is a shorthand command to verify your newly introduced changes on local:

```bash
$ yarn verify
```

> This is going to build and test all the packages. This command can also be run in a package's directory to verify that respective package.
